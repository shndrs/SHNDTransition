## Example
To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

If you'are SEGUE fan then you gonna like this as HELL!!! üòÉ
Actually it is easy as breathing 
### Step 1
Set your segue Kind to ```Show Detail```
### Step 2
Create an instance of  ```SHNDTransitionController``` in your first UIViewController class üëáüèª

```Swift

let transitionDelegate = SHNDTransitionController(animationDuration: 0.5,
                                                  presentTransitionMode: .downToUp,
                                                  dismissTransitionMode: .leftToRight)

```

```presentTransitionMode``` and ```dismissTransitionMode``` are just two simple enums that represent mode of your transition animation.

### Step 3

This step happens in your ```func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) ``` like this üëáüèª

```Swift

override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {

    guard let destination = segue.destination as? SecondViewController else { return }
    destination.transitioningDelegate = self.transitionDelegate
}

```
### Step 4

In your SecondViewController class, you should just dismiss the UIViewController, in here i dismissed it with an UIButton, you can dismiss it with anything you want

```Swift

@IBAction func dismissVC(_ sender: Any) {
    self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}

```
