## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

actually is easy as blink breathing 

first of all you create a instance of SHNDTransitionController in your first UIViewController class üëáüèª

```Swift

let transitionDelegate = SHNDTransitionController(animationDuration: 0.5,
                                                  presentTransitionMode: .downToUp,
                                                  dismissTransitionMode: .leftToRight)

```

```presentTransitionMode``` and ```dismissTransitionMode``` are just two simple Enums that represent Mode of your transition animation.

and final step happens in your ```func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) ``` like this

```Swift

override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
    let destination = segue.destination
    destination.transitioningDelegate = transitionDelegate
}

```

now in your Second UIViewController class you just should dismiss the ViewController, in here i dismissed it with an UIButton you can dismiss it with anything you want

```Swift

@IBAction func dismissVC(_ sender: Any) {
    self.dismiss(animated: true)
}

```
